<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](/screenshot.png)

I think for me the most complicated part about this project was to generate the questions from the api data, more than the design, this piece of functionality really challenged me, and I discovered [Immerjs](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) which is amazing for use with useReducer, if you are a fan of the reducer approach I certainly recommend to give it a look.
